## NEXT TIME:


- start on solving (scary)

## Other stuff TODO:

### General

- 8 UNDO and REDO button!
- 8 editable expression component!
- 6 infinite pannable camera 
    - grab icon panning tool
    - home icon tool that bring you to original position
    - spacebar on laptop
- 5 cool one! fake loading bar for expression recognition - seriously improves UX
- 4 make a robust way to represent expressions with promises so the user can graph/solve them before they load
- 2 add different settings for the tools that pop down in a different menu (stoke width, color, etc. ) - make it cute
- 1 switch HMER select button to having a little AI star

### Graphs:

- 4 QOL make it so that you can drag an expression from one graph to another
- 4 QOL EASY make it so that you can drag another graph with only one expression onto a graph to add it
- 6 make it so that hovering a graph with an expression blurs/makes it clear you can drop it in. noone will know you can do that.
- also consider (later) making it so that you can select a portion of the graph to set the bounds
