### To Install/Develop:
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- Open `frontend/` directory
- Install dependencies with `npm i`
- Run development build with `npm run dev`
  - first boot will take a while because TexTeller needs to install dependences

Built with Vue! Yay!
